GoSy Meditate
================
Pebble app that helps you meditate. I use it to get through 1 hour sittings.

Features
----------------
Stop watch that vibrates at configurable points. Vibration length can be set.

Tracks how many days in a row app has been used. Set manually with middle click on Statistics.

Installation
----------------
Now that Pebble app store is not working anymore the application file has to be sideloaded to your watch.

1. On your phone, download the latest .pbw file from [releases](https://github.com/gotling/GoSy-Meditate/releases)
2. Open the file with Pebble
3. Confirm that you want to *Load External App*
